 This tuner originated from some works of Bjørn Roche who inspired me to code audio myself :-)
 
 What I learned from the newer Tuner Apps available on the market is, they should be intuitive.
 
 Instead of just doing fft, this tuner uses the yin implementation from tarsos dsp, thanx to you
 guys over at belgium ! Really every user of this app should buy you a big mug of coffee :-)))
  
 greetings, and don't forget to play your guitar.
